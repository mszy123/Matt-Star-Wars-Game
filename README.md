## Description

My game is Star Wars themed, specifically from The Mandalorian TV show. The player is The Mandalorian and has to defeat enemies and prevent them from reaching past the yellow line and his kid.

### Custom Features & Game Mechanics

- Press spacebar to shoot lasers.
- Player can "get" a lightsaber, allowing them to "cut down" any enemy by walking into them (like a star in Super Mario).
- The lightsaber does not last forever and there is a timer bar in the top left corner that tells the user how much time they have left with the lightsaber.
- The game keeps track of tick time and displays it at the end on the postgame screen so the user can keep track of the best time it took them to win.

### Win + Lose Conditions

**Lose conditions:**

- An enemy gets past the yellow line.
- Player loses all HP.

**Win conditions:**

- Get 100 points.
  - Stormtrooper = 1 point
  - Darktrooper = 2 points (should take around 1-2 minutes)
